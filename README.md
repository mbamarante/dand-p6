# Summary

RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning of 15 April 1912,
after colliding with an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the 2,224 passengers
and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in
modern history.

The following database shows information from 891 of these passengers. It seems that the saying women and
children first, worked. What do you think?

# Design

The general idea is to spatially visualize the numbers of survivors, dead, and gender, as quickly and easily as possible.
